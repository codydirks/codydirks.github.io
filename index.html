				I’m an astronomy graduate student at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. My research focuses on studying the interstellar medium – that is, all the extra gas and dust floating around the galaxy that isn’t part of stars/planets/etc. I’m also involved in a variety of science education and public outreach programs, with the aim of keeping people outside the realm of academia informed and interested in all things astronomy.
